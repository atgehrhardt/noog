# Roadmap

- [ ] Implement SSL to fix PWA functionality. Important to make sure this doesn't conflitc with OWUI.
    - Thought: Can we just have docker container have it's own IP served over 0.0.0.0 so it's accessible over the network?

- [ ] Add ability to check cards so that they grey out, strike out the text, and move below the unchecked ones to indicate which have been applied to.

- [ ] Add ability to completely hide cards in a collabsible section that is collapsed by default whenever the page lods

- [ ] Add ability to use or not use proxies with a bool in .env file
